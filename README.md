* unhcr-erff-validation-tool-x.x.x.jar is a Java library which can be included in any Java project. Any additional dependencies are read from the pom.xml file.

* unhcr-erff-validation-tool-x.x.x-full.jar contains all dependent libraries and can be run from command line and in GUI-mode.


# Usage from command line
java -jar unhcr-erff-validation-tool-x.x.x-full.jar -f case-file.xml

Arguments:

--delete-config: delete local config file

-f,--file: case files to validate (space-separated)
(multiple files can be validated)

-g,--gui: start GUI. (Java version 11 (or higher) is required)

-h,--help: show help

-p,--parser: parser version(s) to use (space-separated): v3 v4 (also supports wild-chars, e.g. 'v4*')

-w,--web-port=8080: start web-server on a given port. (Java version 11 (or higher) is required)

When validation (of every listed file) succeeds, exit code is 0.


# Usage from GUI
To start GUI mode, start a command line application without any arguments (if Java is configured on a machine, then double-clicking on a jar application will start GUI). **Note: Java version 11 (or higher) is required to start GUI mode.**

GUI application supports drag-and-drop of case files (or folders) and re-validations. Case files are validated as soon as they are added.

# Usage as web server

To start web-server mode, start a command line application with --web-port=8080 argument. Embedded server will display web interface with form and validate button. Request path is 'validate'. **Note: Java version 11 (or higher) is required to start web server mode.**

Additionally, web server mode supports REST api to retrieve validation data as json object. To use validation tool as REST, append json to request path:

```curl -X POST --data-binary @src/test/resources/uk/gov/homeoffice/unhcr/cases/test/V4-TEST-CrossReference.xml "http://0.0.0.0:8080/api/v1/validate"```

# Usage from Java projects

To validate a case file, create a CaseFileValidator and execute validate(InputStream) function. The return object ValidationResult contains the list of raised validation errors.
```
InputStream caseFileInputStream = ...
ValdiationResultÂ validationResult = new CaseFileValidator().validate(caseFileInputStream);
if (!validationResult.isSuccess()) validationResult.getErrors()
...
```

Note: when building from repository for the first time, generate jaxb bindings for xml schema definitions by running the below maven command:
```
mvn clean compile
```
