# Usage from command line
java -jar unhcr-erff-validation-tool-x.x.x-full.jar -f case-file.xml

Arguments:

-f,--file: case files to validate (space-separated)
(multiple files can be validated)

-g,--gui: start GUI
Java version 11 (or higher) is required

-h,--help: show help

-p,--parser: parser version(s) to use (space-separated): v3 v4 (also supports wild-chars, e.g. 'v4*')

When validation (of every listed file) succeeds, exit code is 0.


# Usage from GUI
To start GUI mode, start a command line application without any arguments (if Java is configured on a machine, then double-clicking on a jar application will start GUI).

GUI application supports drag-and-drop of case files (or folders) and re-validations. Case files are validated as soon as they are added.

Note: Java version 11 (or higher) is required.

# Usage from Java projects

To validate a case file, create a CaseFileValidator and execute validate(InputStream) function. The return object ValidationResult contains the list of raised validation errors.
```
InputStream caseFileInputStream = ...
ValdiationResultÂ validationResult = new CaseFileValidator().validate(caseFileInputStream);
if (!validationResult.isSuccess()) validationResult.getErrors()
...
```
